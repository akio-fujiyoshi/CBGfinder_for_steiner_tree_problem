# CBGfinder_for_steiner_tree_problem
This is a variation of CBGfinder specialized in steiner tree problem for PACE 2018 competition.

### Algorithm
The algorithm is based on the Graphset-Subgraph Matching Method of CBGfinder.
CBGfinder is a software for given graphs to find subgraphs (any subgraphs, spanning sugraphs or induced subgraphs) accepted by an automaton.
For speed-up, the reduce method of Bodlaender et. al. was implemented.
